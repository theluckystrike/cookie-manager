# Agent 1: Keyword Intelligence & Metadata Optimization Audit

## Phase 07 | ASO & Conversion Strategy | Generated 2026-02-11

---

## Executive Summary

This audit maps the full keyword landscape for the Zovo Cookie Manager Chrome extension, identifies high-value gaps left by competitors (especially the EditThisCookie removal), and provides optimized metadata variants for the Chrome Web Store listing. The goal is to capture maximum organic search traffic from 3M+ displaced EditThisCookie users and outrank the current top competitors: Cookie-Editor (~330K users), EditThisCookie fork (~1M users), J2TEAM Cookies (~200K users), and Cookie AutoDelete (~500K users).

Chrome-Stats data shows 300+ extensions ranking for the "cookie" keyword with a keyword difficulty of 69. Our strategy focuses on owning compound keywords ("cookie manager for developers", "edit cookies chrome extension") where difficulty drops significantly and intent is higher.

## 1. Keyword Research Map

### 1.1 Primary Keywords (Highest Search Volume, Direct Intent)

These are the head terms that users type directly into the Chrome Web Store search bar or Google when looking for a cookie management tool. Each keyword is scored on estimated relative search volume (1-10) and competition level (Low/Medium/High).

| 4 | import export cookies | 4/10 | Low | Developer/QA workflow keyword. |

### 1.4 Competitor Keyword Gap Analysis

Analysis of keywords competitors rank for (or fail to rank for) that represent capture opportunities.

#### Cookie-Editor (cgagnier) — ~330K users, 4.6 rating

**Keywords they own:**
- "cookie editor" (name match)
- "edit cookies chrome" (strong ranking)
- "cookie editor chrome extension" (exact match)
- "create edit delete cookies" (description match)
- "json cookie export" (feature keyword)

**Keywords they miss:**
- "cookie profiles" (they do not offer profiles)
- "cookie auto delete" (no auto-delete rules)
- "cookie health" (no health scoring)
- "GDPR cookie" (no compliance features)
- "cookie manager" (their name is "editor" not "manager")
- "editthiscookie replacement" (no explicit positioning)
- "curl cookies" (no cURL generation)
- "cookie monitor" (no monitoring feature)

**Our opportunity:** Cookie-Editor's name does not contain "manager" — we own that term. They also have no premium features, profiles, health scoring, or compliance scanning. Every feature keyword they miss is one we should embed in our description.

#### EditThisCookie (removed) & Fork (~1M users)

**Keywords the fork captures:**
- "editthiscookie" (brand name match)
- "editthiscookie fork" (explicit positioning)
- "edit this cookie" (misspelling/spacing variant)

**Keywords the fork misses:**
- "editthiscookie alternative" (they position as fork, not alternative)
- "editthiscookie replacement" (same gap)
- "cookie manager" (not in their name)
- "cookie profiles" (not offered)
- "modern cookie editor" (not claimed)
- "manifest v3 cookie" (not emphasized in metadata)
- "secure cookie editor" (trust keywords not claimed)

**Our opportunity:** The fork positions as a continuation of the original, not as a modern alternative. We should explicitly target "editthiscookie alternative" and "editthiscookie replacement" in our description. The fork inherits the original's MV2 reputation — we can differentiate with "built from scratch on Manifest V3."

#### J2TEAM Cookies — ~200K users, 4.81 rating

**Keywords they own:**
- "j2team cookies" (brand)
- "share cookies" (unique feature)
- "export import cookies" (core feature)
- "encrypted cookies" (security feature)

**Keywords they miss:**
- "cookie editor" (their name is "cookies" not "editor")
- "cookie manager" (not in name)
- "cookie profiles" (different from their sharing model)
- "cookie auto delete" (not offered)
- "cookie health" (not offered)
- "developer cookie tool" (positioned for VAs, not devs)
- "GDPR cookie" (not offered)
- "cookie compliance" (not offered)

**Our opportunity:** J2TEAM is popular with Filipino VAs for account sharing. We target the same audience but with a broader feature set. Embed "manage client cookies" and "multi-account cookie manager" to capture this segment without competing on their brand terms.

#### Cookie Tab Viewer / Cookie Editor & Storage Manager

**Keywords they own:**
- "cookie viewer" (name match)
- "cookie and storage" (dual functionality)
- "view cookies" (read-only intent)

**Keywords they miss:**
- "cookie editor" (positioned as viewer, not editor)
- "cookie manager" (not in name)
- Everything related to profiles, rules, health, compliance

**Our opportunity:** These are simpler tools. Every advanced feature keyword is uncontested.

#### Cookie AutoDelete — ~500K users, 4.5 rating

**Keywords they own:**
- "cookie auto delete" (exact name match)
- "auto delete cookies" (variant)
- "delete cookies tab close" (core use case)
- "cookie whitelist" (feature keyword)

**Keywords they miss:**
- "cookie editor" (they only delete, not edit)
- "cookie manager" (not a manager)
- "cookie profiles" (not offered)
- "export cookies" (not offered)
- "cookie health" (not offered)

**Our opportunity:** Cookie AutoDelete is single-purpose (deletion). We offer auto-delete PLUS everything else. Target "auto delete cookies chrome" in our description to capture users who want deletion alongside editing and profiles.

#### Keyword Gap Summary — Uncontested Terms We Must Own

| Keyword | Any Competitor Ranking? | Our Feature Match? |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------|
| cookie profiles | No | Yes (core differentiator) |
| cookie health score | No | Yes (unique feature) |
| GDPR cookie scanner | No | Yes (unique feature) |
| cookie compliance checker | No | Yes (unique feature) |
| curl cookies extension | No | Yes (unique feature) |
| cookie monitor chrome | No | Yes (Pro feature) |
| editthiscookie alternative | Weakly (fork only) | Strong positioning opportunity |
| editthiscookie replacement 2026 | No | Must own |
| cookie manager for developers | No | Primary audience match |
| cookie manager for QA | No | Primary audience match |
| save restore cookies chrome | No | Yes (profiles feature) |
| switch cookie environments | No | Yes (profiles feature) |
| modern cookie editor | No | Brand positioning match |
| manifest v3 cookie manager | No | Technical differentiator |
| bulk cookie operations | No | Yes (Pro feature) |

## 2. Metadata Optimization

### 2.1 Extension Name Optimization

**Current name:** "Zovo Cookie Manager"
**Character count:** 19 characters

Chrome Web Store enforces a 75-character limit for extension names (previously 45 for English). The name field is the single most important ranking signal. Front-loading the primary keyword is essential.

**Recommended name variants, ranked by keyword strength:**

| Rank | Name Variant | Chars | Keywords Hit | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Cookie Manager - Edit & Export Cookies | 39 | cookie manager, edit cookies, export cookies | Front-loads primary keyword. Hits 3 high-volume terms. Action verbs signal utility. |
| 2 | Cookie Manager & Editor - Profiles, Export, Auto-Delete | 53 | cookie manager, editor, profiles, export, auto-delete | Maximum keyword density while remaining readable. Mentions 3 unique features. |
| 3 | Cookie Manager by Zovo - Edit, Export & Profiles | 48 | cookie manager, edit, export, profiles, zovo | Brand inclusion with keyword leadership. Highlights unique feature (profiles). |
| 4 | Cookie Editor & Manager - Export, Profiles, Auto-Clean | 52 | cookie editor, manager, export, profiles, auto-clean | Leads with "editor" to capture EditThisCookie refugees. |
| 5 | Zovo Cookie Manager - Edit, Delete & Export Cookies | 50 | cookie manager, edit, delete, export cookies, zovo | Brand-first but still keyword-rich. Best if brand recognition is already established. |

**Recommendation:** Use variant **#1** ("Cookie Manager - Edit & Export Cookies") for launch. It front-loads the primary keyword, is clean and readable at 39 characters (fully visible in all CWS layouts), and hits the three highest-volume action keywords. Once the Zovo brand has traction (1,000+ users), consider switching to variant **#3** to build brand equity.

**Name to avoid:** "Zovo Cookie Manager" alone — it buries the category keyword behind a brand name nobody knows yet. Brand-first naming only works when users search for your brand.

### 2.2 Short Description Optimization (132 chars max)

The short description appears directly below the extension name in Chrome Web Store search results. It must contain primary and secondary keywords naturally while communicating the value proposition.

**Scoring criteria for each variant:**
- Keyword density (0-3): How many target keywords are embedded
- Clarity (0-3): How quickly a user understands what this does
- Action-oriented (0-3): Does it start with or contain action verbs
- Benefit inclusion (0-3): Does it communicate a benefit, not just a feature

| # | Short Description Variant | Chars | KW Density | Clarity | Action | Benefit | Total |
|---|--------------------------|-------|------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1 | View, edit, export & auto-delete cookies. Cookie profiles, health scores, and cURL generation for developers. | 109 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 11/12 |
| 2 | The modern cookie editor: manage, export, and auto-delete cookies with profiles and one-click environment switching. | 116 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 12/12 |
| 3 | Edit cookies, save profiles, auto-delete trackers. Built on Manifest V3 -- the EditThisCookie replacement developers trust. | 124 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 11/12 |
| 4 | Cookie editor & manager with profiles, auto-delete rules, export/import, health scores. Fast, private, MV3-native. | 115 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 10/12 |
| 5 | Manage cookies with one-click profiles, auto-cleanup rules, and full export. The cookie manager built for developers. | 117 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 11/12 |

**Recommendation:** Use variant **#2** for launch. It scores highest overall, leads with "modern cookie editor" (captures EditThisCookie refugees), includes "manage" and "cookies" for the manager keyword, and closes with "environment switching" which targets the developer segment's exact workflow language.

**A/B testing order:**
1. Start with #2 (highest score)
2. After 2 weeks, test #3 (EditThisCookie replacement angle — may capture more displaced users)
3. After 4 weeks, test #1 (feature-dense, may work better once we have reviews)

### 2.3 Detailed Description Keyword Placement Strategy

The CWS detailed description supports up to ~16,000 characters. Keyword placement must be strategic — the algorithm weighs early mentions more heavily, and the first ~140 characters appear before the "Read more" fold.

#### Structure with keyword placement points:

```

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

#### Current Description Gaps (from agent1-store-listing.md)

The current store listing is well-written but has these keyword gaps:

| Gap | Current State | Recommended Fix |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| No "editthiscookie" mention before fold | Not mentioned until WHY section | Add to first 140 chars or WHY section opener |
| No FAQ section | Missing entirely | Add 5-6 question-based keyword FAQ entries |
| "cookie editor" only in short desc | Appears once in body text | Add 2-3 more natural mentions in features and FAQ |
| No "alternative" or "replacement" keywords | Not present | Add "the modern EditThisCookie alternative" |
| No privacy-user segment targeting | Only devs, QA, marketers | Add a "Privacy-conscious users" paragraph |
| No "manifest v3" in feature text | Only in WHY section | Reinforce in FAQ and trust section |
| No "best cookie manager" or "best cookie editor" | Not claimed | Add to opening or FAQ naturally |
| Missing "auto delete cookies tab close" | Says "tab or schedule" generically | Use the exact long-tail keyword verbatim |
| No "save and restore cookies" | Uses "save a complete cookie state" | Use both phrasings for keyword coverage |
| No "multi-account" keyword | Not mentioned | Add to VA/marketer use case paragraph |

### 2.4 Recommended Description Rewrite (First 140 Characters)

**Current opening (first 140 chars):**
> "Tired of digging through Chrome DevTools just to inspect a session cookie? Frustrated by cookie managers that disappeared overnight or dema"

**Problems:** No primary keyword in first 140 chars. Starts with a question (low keyword density). "cookie managers" appears but is buried in a question.

**Recommended opening (first 140 chars):**

Option A (Feature-led):
> "The modern cookie manager and editor for Chrome. Edit, export, save profiles, and auto-delete cookies. Built natively on Manifest V3."

(131 chars. Keywords hit: cookie manager, editor, chrome, edit, export, profiles, auto-delete cookies, manifest v3.)

Option B (Replacement-led):
> "Cookie manager and editor built to replace EditThisCookie. Edit, export, auto-delete, and save cookie profiles. MV3-native, privacy-first."

(140 chars. Keywords hit: cookie manager, editor, editthiscookie, edit, export, auto-delete, cookie profiles, mv3, privacy.)

Option C (Benefit-led):
> "Edit, manage, and export cookies in seconds. Save cookie profiles, auto-delete trackers, and scan for privacy risks. The best cookie editor."

(140 chars. Keywords hit: edit, manage, export cookies, cookie profiles, auto-delete, privacy, best cookie editor.)

**Recommendation:** Use **Option B** for the first 60 days (capitalize on EditThisCookie displacement traffic). Then switch to **Option A** as the market stabilizes and brand searches grow.

## 3. Monthly Metadata Refresh Calendar

### 3.1 Twelve-Month Testing & Refresh Schedule

| Month | Focus Area | What to Test/Update | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Month 1** (Launch) | Extension name | Test variant #1 vs #3 (keyword-first vs brand-first) | Establish baseline ranking. Front-loaded keyword names typically outperform brand-first at <1K users. |
| **Month 1** | Short description | Deploy variant #2, track CTR | Set baseline for A/B testing. |
| **Month 1** | Description opening | Deploy Option B (replacement-led) | Capture maximum EditThisCookie refugee traffic. |
| **Month 2** | Short description A/B | Test variant #2 vs #3 (EditThisCookie angle) | Determine if "replacement" messaging converts better than "modern editor" messaging. |
| **Month 2** | FAQ section | Add 6 question-based keyword entries | Improve long-tail keyword coverage. FAQ questions match voice search patterns. |
| **Month 3** | Description body | Add privacy-user segment paragraph | Expand audience targeting. Privacy keywords spike in March/April (spring cleaning mentality). |
| **Month 3** | Short description A/B | Test winner from M2 vs variant #1 (feature-dense) | Determine if keyword density or clarity wins. |
| **Month 4** | Extension name | If >1K users, test brand-inclusive variant (#3) | Brand recognition may justify brand-in-name at this point. |
| **Month 4** | Description refresh | Update user count social proof ("Join X,000+ users") | Social proof increases CTR. Update monthly once count is meaningful. |
| **Month 5** | Seasonal keywords | Add "spring cleaning cookies" and "clear browser data" | Seasonal search trend: browser cleanup spikes in April-May. |
| **Month 6** | Mid-year audit | Full keyword position check for all 52 long-tail terms | Identify which keywords we rank for and which need reinforcement. |
| **Month 7** | Description structure | Test moving FAQ above features section | FAQ-first may improve long-tail keyword indexing. |
| **Month 8** | Seasonal keywords | Remove spring cleaning language, add back-to-work keywords | "Developer tools" searches spike Aug-Sep (back to school/work). |
| **Month 9** | Extension name | Final name optimization based on 6 months of data | Lock in the highest-performing name variant for Q4. |
| **Month 10** | Seasonal keywords | Add "GDPR compliance", "cookie audit", "data privacy" | European Cookie Awareness and October Cybersecurity Awareness Month. |
| **Month 11** | Description refresh | Update features to reflect new Pro capabilities | Keep description current with product evolution. |
| **Month 12** | Annual audit | Full competitive keyword gap re-analysis | Market shifts yearly. New competitors, removed extensions, trend changes. |

### 3.2 Seasonal Keyword Calendar

| Period | Event/Trend | Keywords to Emphasize | Action |
|--------|------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Jan 28** | Data Privacy Day / Data Protection Day | "data privacy", "cookie privacy", "GDPR cookies", "protect cookies" | Add privacy-forward language to description 2 weeks before. Remove by mid-Feb. |
| **Feb 12** | EDPS Conference (2026) | "data protection", "cookie compliance" | Minor boost, reinforce compliance keywords. |
| **Mar-Apr** | Spring cleaning / Browser cleanup trend | "clear cookies", "clean browser cookies", "delete old cookies" | Add cleanup-oriented language. Emphasize auto-delete rules feature. |
| **May 25** | GDPR Anniversary (enacted May 25, 2018) | "GDPR cookie compliance", "cookie audit", "tracking cookies" | Emphasize GDPR scan feature in description for 2 weeks. |
| **Aug-Sep** | Back to school / New developer season | "developer tools", "web development cookies", "QA testing tools" | Emphasize developer/QA use cases. |
| **Oct** | Cybersecurity Awareness Month | "secure cookies", "cookie security", "browser privacy" | Full security-forward description variant for the month. |
| **Nov-Dec** | Holiday shopping / Black Friday | "manage cookies", "cookie privacy shopping" | Minor. Privacy awareness spikes during holiday shopping. |
| **Dec** | EditThisCookie removal anniversary | "editthiscookie alternative 2026", "editthiscookie replacement" | Reinforce replacement messaging. Anniversary content opportunity. |

### 3.3 A/B Testing Queue (Prioritized)

| Priority | Test | Control | Variant | Success Metric | Min Duration |
|----------|------|---------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| P0 | Extension name keyword placement | "Zovo Cookie Manager" | "Cookie Manager - Edit & Export Cookies" | Install rate from search | 14 days |
| P0 | Short description angle | Feature-dense (#1) | EditThisCookie replacement (#3) | Install rate from search | 14 days |
| P1 | Description opening | Current question-based hook | Keyword-rich Option B | Detail page → install conversion | 14 days |
| P1 | FAQ section presence | No FAQ | 6-question FAQ added | Long-tail keyword impressions | 21 days |
| P2 | Privacy segment paragraph | Not present | Added privacy-user segment | Install rate from privacy-related searches | 14 days |
| P2 | Name with "Editor" | "Cookie Manager - ..." | "Cookie Editor & Manager - ..." | Impressions for "cookie editor" searches | 14 days |
| P3 | User count social proof | No count mentioned | "Join X,000+ users" in description | Detail page → install conversion | 14 days |
| P3 | Seasonal keyword rotation | Static description | Privacy keywords added in Jan/Oct | Impressions during seasonal periods | 30 days |

**Testing methodology:** Chrome Web Store does not natively support A/B testing. Tests are run sequentially — change one variable, measure for 14-21 days, compare to previous period with same traffic baseline. Track impressions, detail page views, and installs through Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard analytics.

## 4. Search Ranking Strategy

### 4.1 Capturing the EditThisCookie Vacuum (3M+ Orphaned Users)

This is the single largest organic acquisition opportunity in the cookie extension market. Here is the multi-channel capture strategy:

#### Chrome Web Store Search Capture

**Action items:**
1. Include "EditThisCookie alternative" and "EditThisCookie replacement" verbatim in the description body (not the name — CWS policy prohibits using competitor names in extension names)
2. Add a dedicated FAQ entry: "Is this an EditThisCookie replacement?" with a detailed answer mentioning MV3, modern features, and trust
3. Front-load the description with the replacement narrative for the first 60 days while displaced-user search volume is highest
4. Monitor CWS search rankings for "editthiscookie" weekly — if the fork loses ranking (due to policy issues or poor updates), be ready to capture

#### Google Search Capture

**Action items:**
1. Create a landing page at `zovo.one/editthiscookie-alternative` targeting "editthiscookie alternative 2026"
2. Blog post: "EditThisCookie Was Removed: Here Are the Best Alternatives in 2026" — include Zovo Cookie Manager as the recommended option
3. Target related Google searches:
   - "editthiscookie not working 2026"
   - "editthiscookie removed chrome"
   - "editthiscookie manifest v3"
   - "editthiscookie replacement extension"
4. Submit to AlternativeTo.net as an alternative to EditThisCookie

#### Community Capture

**Action items:**
1. Monitor Reddit threads in r/chrome, r/webdev, r/QualityAssurance for EditThisCookie questions
2. Provide genuine, helpful answers that mention Zovo Cookie Manager naturally
3. Answer relevant StackOverflow questions about cookie management in Chrome with references to the extension
4. Engage in dev.to discussions about Chrome extension MV3 migration

#### Timeline

| Timeframe | EditThisCookie Displacement Phase | Our Action |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Month 1-3 | Peak displacement. Users actively searching for replacements. | Maximum "replacement/alternative" keyword emphasis. Aggressive content. |
| Month 3-6 | Displacement stabilizes. Users settle on alternatives. | Shift from "replacement" to "best cookie manager" positioning. |
| Month 6-12 | Market resets. New normal established. | Full brand positioning. "Replacement" language moves to FAQ only. |
| Month 12+ | EditThisCookie becomes historical. | Remove explicit replacement language. Market is ours to define. |

### 4.2 "Alternative To" Content Strategy

Create comparison and alternative content targeting each competitor's dissatisfied users:

| Content Piece | Target Keyword | Channel | Priority |
|--------------|---------------|---------|----------|
| "Zovo Cookie Manager vs Cookie-Editor: Which Is Better in 2026?" | cookie-editor alternative, best cookie editor chrome | Blog, Medium | High |
| "5 Best EditThisCookie Alternatives After Its Removal" | editthiscookie alternative 2026, editthiscookie replacement | Blog, dev.to | Highest |
| "J2TEAM Cookies vs Zovo Cookie Manager for VAs" | j2team cookies alternative | Blog | Medium |
| "Cookie AutoDelete vs Zovo: Auto-Delete + Full Management" | cookie auto delete alternative | Blog | Medium |
| "Best Cookie Manager Extensions for Chrome in 2026" | best cookie manager chrome, best cookie editor | Blog, Medium | High |
| "How to Manage Cookies Like a Pro Developer in Chrome" | manage cookies chrome, developer cookie tool | dev.to | High |
| "Cookie Profiles: The Feature No Other Extension Offers" | cookie profiles chrome, switch cookie environments | Blog | Medium |
| "GDPR Cookie Compliance: How to Audit Cookies in Chrome" | GDPR cookie scanner, cookie compliance checker | Blog | Medium |

**Publishing cadence:** 2 pieces per week for the first month, then 1 per week ongoing.

### 4.3 Keyword Trends to Monitor

Set up ongoing monitoring for these keyword signals:

#### Rising Trend Indicators (Act fast when these spike)

| Signal | Likely Cause | Our Response |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| "editthiscookie" search spike | Fork gets removed or has security issue | Push replacement messaging hard. Update description immediately. |
| "cookie-editor" negative sentiment | Bad update, security concern, or removal | Publish comparison content. Update "alternative" language. |
| "manifest v2 removed" spike | Google accelerates MV2 deprecation | Emphasize "MV3-native" in all metadata. |
| "cookie privacy" spike | Data breach news, regulation news | Emphasize privacy features, GDPR scanner. Seasonal keyword rotation. |
| "chrome extension security" spike | Malicious extension news (like EditThisCookie copycat) | Emphasize "open source", "transparent permissions", "no host access". |

#### Declining Trend Indicators (Adjust strategy when these drop)

| Signal | Likely Cause | Our Response |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| "editthiscookie" searches declining | Market memory fading | Reduce replacement language. Shift to category leadership positioning. |
| "cookie manager" volume dropping | Market saturation or Google changing cookie behavior | Broaden to "browser data manager" or "storage manager" keywords. |
| "cookies chrome" ambiguity increasing | Users confusing browser cookies with food recipes | Use more specific compound keywords ("browser cookies manager"). |

#### New Opportunity Indicators (New keywords to target)

| Signal | Opportunity | Our Response |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Chrome adding new cookie APIs | New features to build | Update keywords for new capabilities. First-mover on feature keywords. |
| New privacy regulations | Compliance feature demand | Emphasize GDPR scanner. Add regulation-specific keywords. |
| AI/LLM tools integrating with browsers | "AI cookie manager" searches | Evaluate AI feature additions. Be early on "AI cookie" keywords. |
| Third-party cookie deprecation news | "third party cookies chrome" spikes | Content about managing first-party vs third-party cookies. |

### 4.4 Keyword Density Targets by Metadata Field

| Field | Primary Keyword Target | Secondary Keywords | Max Repetitions |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Extension name | "cookie manager" (1x) | "edit", "export" (1x each) | No repeats — CWS penalizes name stuffing |
| Short description | "cookie" (1-2x), "editor" or "manager" (1x) | Feature keywords (2-3) | Max 2x for "cookie" |
| Description (first 500 chars) | "cookie manager" (1x), "cookie editor" (1x) | "editthiscookie" (1x), "manifest v3" (1x) | No more than 3x "cookie" per 500 chars |
| Description (full body) | "cookie" (12-18x total across 3500 chars) | Long-tail keywords (1x each, natural embedding) | Stay under 1% density for any single term to avoid spam detection |
| FAQ section | Question-based keywords (1x each as headers) | Answer-embedded keywords (1-2x each) | Each Q/A pair targets a unique keyword |

## Appendix A: Chrome Web Store Search Algorithm Notes

Based on observed behavior and community research:

1. **Extension name carries the highest weight.** Front-loading primary keywords in the name is the single most impactful ASO action.
2. **Short description is the second-highest signal.** It appears in search results and influences both ranking and click-through.
3. **Detailed description keyword density matters but has diminishing returns.** CWS appears to penalize keyword stuffing (repetition >2% density for a single term).
4. **Install count and velocity are ranking factors.** More installs = higher ranking. Fast-growing extensions get a temporary boost.
5. **Rating and review count affect ranking.** 4.5+ with 50+ reviews is the threshold for competitive ranking.
6. **Active user retention matters.** Extensions with high uninstall rates rank lower over time.
7. **Category placement affects discoverability.** "Developer Tools" is the right category for our audience but has lower browse traffic than "Productivity." Consider dual-listing if CWS allows.
8. **Localized metadata (future opportunity).** CWS supports localized names and descriptions. Spanish, Portuguese, and Filipino localizations would capture VA segment.
