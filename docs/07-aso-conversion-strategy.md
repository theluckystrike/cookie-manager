## Key Decisions from This Phase

1. **Front-load keywords in extension name.** CWS search weighs the first 2-3 words of the extension name most heavily. "Cookie Editor" or "Cookie Manager" should lead the name, with "Zovo" positioned after for brand recognition.
2. **EditThisCookie displacement is the #1 acquisition opportunity.** With 3M+ orphaned users and declining competitor quality, targeting "editthiscookie alternative/replacement" keywords in metadata and content is the highest-ROI action.
3. **Loss-aversion paywall copy over feature-listing.** A/B test hypothesis predicts 20-30% higher paywall click-through with "Don't lose your saved environments" framing versus "Unlock Unlimited Profiles."
4. **Two-step review prompts only.** Never direct users to the CWS review page without a satisfaction gate ("Are you enjoying?"). This is both a CWS policy best practice and filters out negative reviews.
5. **Sequential metadata A/B testing.** CWS does not support simultaneous A/B tests for metadata. Run each variant for 14 days and compare same-day-of-week cohorts for statistical validity.
6. **38 analytics events, not 33.** Expanded the Phase 02 event set with 5 additional ASO-specific and micro-conversion events to support the full testing roadmap.
7. **Quarterly pricing reviews, not annual.** Developer tool pricing is competitive and fast-moving. Review pricing strategy, feature gating boundaries, and tier structure every quarter.
8. **Email frequency caps are strict.** Maximum 1 marketing email per 48 hours, 3 per week, 8 per month. Never send marketing email within 24 hours of a transactional email. Timezone-aware sending only.
