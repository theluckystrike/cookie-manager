# Chrome Web Store Listing

## 1. Short Description (132 characters)

View, edit, export, and manage browser cookies. Built for developers, QA engineers, and privacy-conscious users.

## 2. Detailed Description

Managing browser cookies shouldn't require digging through DevTools. Cookie Manager gives you a clean, dedicated interface to inspect and control cookies on any site -- instantly.

**Key Features:**

- View all cookies for the current site or across all domains
- Edit cookie values, expiration dates, and flags in a simple editor
- Delete individual cookies or clear them in bulk
- Search and filter cookies by name, domain, or value
- Export cookies in JSON or Netscape format
- Detect and decode JWT tokens stored in cookies
- Read-only mode to prevent accidental edits
- Keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation
- Right-click context menu for quick cookie actions

Cookie Manager serves one purpose: giving you complete control over browser cookies.

**Privacy First:**
100% local. Zero network requests. Your cookies and data never leave your browser -- no analytics servers, no telemetry, no tracking. The code is open source for full transparency.

**Pro (coming soon):**
Bulk export/import, cookie profiles, cross-device sync, protected cookies, and cookie change alerts. Free core features remain free forever. Pro starts at $4/month or $36/year.

## 3. Category Recommendation

**Developer Tools**

Cookie Manager's primary audience is web developers and QA engineers who inspect and manipulate cookies during development and testing. Developer Tools is the most accurate category and aligns with the single-purpose framing. Avoid "Productivity" -- it is too broad and may trigger review scrutiny for misrepresentation.

## 4. Single Purpose Statement

Cookie Manager allows users to view, edit, export, and delete browser cookies for web development, testing, and privacy.

## 5. Screenshots Guidance

| # | Screen | Caption |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | Main cookie list view | View all cookies for the current site at a glance |
| 2 | Cookie editor modal | Edit any cookie value, path, expiration, or flag |
| 3 | JWT decoder panel | Detect and decode JWT tokens stored in cookies |
| 4 | Export dialog (JSON/Netscape) | Export cookies in JSON or Netscape format |
| 5 | Context menu and read-only toggle | Quick actions via right-click; read-only mode prevents accidental changes |

Tips: Use a real site with recognizable but non-sensitive cookie names. Keep screenshots at 1280x800. Avoid placeholder data -- reviewers check that screenshots match actual functionality.
