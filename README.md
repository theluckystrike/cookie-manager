## Features

- **Export as JSON** — One-click copy all cookies, formatted and ready
- **JWT Decode** — Automatically detect and decode JWT tokens

## Why Cookie Manager?

EditThisCookie (2M+ users) was removed from the Chrome Web Store. Remaining alternatives have complex, cluttered interfaces. Cookie Manager gives developers what they need: simple view/edit/clear functionality with a clean UI.
