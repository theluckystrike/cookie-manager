2. **Edit cookies** - Modify cookie properties including name, value, domain, path, expiration, and security flags
3. **Create cookies** - Add new cookies with specified properties for testing and development
4. **Delete cookies** - Remove individual cookies or clear all cookies for a domain
5. **Export cookies** - Copy all cookies as formatted JSON for use in other tools
