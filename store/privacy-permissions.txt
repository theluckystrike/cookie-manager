# Cookie Manager - Permission Justifications

## cookies

**Why needed:** This is the core permission required for the extension's primary functionality. Cookie Manager uses the Chrome cookies API to read, create, modify, and delete browser cookies.

**How used:** 
- `chrome.cookies.getAll()` retrieves cookies for the current domain to display in the popup
- `chrome.cookies.set()` creates or updates cookies when users edit values
- `chrome.cookies.remove()` deletes cookies when users click delete
- `chrome.cookies.onChanged` listener logs cookie changes for debugging

**Data handling:** Cookie data is only displayed locally in the extension popup. No cookie data is transmitted externally or stored beyond the current session.

## activeTab

**Why needed:** Required to determine the current website's URL so the extension can show relevant cookies.

**How used:** 
- `chrome.tabs.query()` gets the active tab's URL when the popup opens
- The URL's hostname is extracted to filter cookies by domain

**Data handling:** Only the hostname is used. No page content, browsing history, or sensitive URL parameters are accessed or stored.

---

## storage

**Why needed:** Required to persist user preferences across browser sessions.

**How used:**
- `chrome.storage.local.set()` saves user settings like read-only mode preference
- `chrome.storage.local.get()` retrieves settings when the extension loads

**Data handling:** Only simple preference flags (booleans, strings) are stored. No cookie data or personal information is saved to storage.

## host_permissions: <all_urls>

**Why needed:** Required to access cookies for any website the user visits. Without this permission, the extension could only view cookies for specific predefined domains.

**How used:**
- Allows `chrome.cookies.getAll()` to retrieve cookies regardless of which website the user is viewing
- Enables the extension to work universally across all web pages

**Data handling:** This permission grants access capability only. No data is collected, transmitted, or stored from websites. The extension only activates when the user explicitly opens it.

---

## contextMenus

**Why needed:** Provides convenient right-click access to clear cookies without opening the popup.

**How used:**
- Creates a "Clear cookies for this site" context menu item
- Executes cookie clearing when the user selects the menu option

**Data handling:** No data is collected. The menu action only clears cookies for the current domain.

---

## notifications

**Why needed:** Provides user feedback when context menu actions are performed.

**How used:**
- Shows a notification confirming how many cookies were cleared
- Only triggered by explicit user action (context menu click)

**Data handling:** No user data is included in notifications. Only generic confirmation messages are displayed.

---

## alarms

**Why needed:** Required for scheduled background tasks including auto-delete cookie rules and periodic maintenance.

**How used:**
- `chrome.alarms.create()` sets up periodic timers for auto-delete rules configured by the user
- `chrome.alarms.onAlarm` listener executes cookie cleanup when timers fire
- A daily churn-prevention check runs to assess user engagement

**Data handling:** Alarms only trigger internal maintenance functions. No user data is transmitted or collected.
